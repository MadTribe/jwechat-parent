# Description

This project intends to provide a flexible and simple Java API for interaction with Wechat Services

The project goals are that it should be:

Modular - A user should not need to depend on features that they don't use.
Widely compatible, although there will be opinionated decisions about some frameworks, by default it will use Guice for dependency injection and an event bus.

A major intention is to keep the API up to date with the latest Wechat features.
